# Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-ML-Project
Building a system that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not with the help of Machine Learning.This project is done in Python. In this project I have used Logistic Regression.

#Steps Followed-

**1.Importing the required Dependencies**

**2.Data Collection and Analysis**

**3.Separating the features and data -**M for mine, R for rock

**4.Data Standarization-** Standarizing the data in a particular range

**5.Split the data into Training data & Testing**

**6.Model Training -->** Logistic Regression

**7.Data Model Evaluation-**Accuracy score of the training data :0.8342245989304813.. Accuracy score of the test data :0.7619047619047619

**8.Building a Predictive System-** This is the last step.This gives the result whether an object is rock or mine.
